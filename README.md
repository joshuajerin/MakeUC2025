# EmpathLens – AI Social Companion for Meta Ray-Ban Glasses

**Your personal AI therapist and conversation coach, right in your glasses.**

⚠️ **DISCLAIMER**: This is NOT a medical device. This tool provides distress management techniques and social conversation assistance but is not a substitute for professional mental health care, emergency services, or medical advice.

## Overview

EmpathLens integrates with your Meta Ray-Ban Smart Glasses to provide two powerful features:

### 1. Panic Attack & Distress Management
Real-time, voice-based support during anxiety, panic, or overwhelming moments:
- **Detects distress** from your voice messages
- **Guides breathing exercises** with calming voice instructions
- **Provides grounding techniques** to help you regain control
- **Adapts in real-time** based on how you're feeling
- **Escalates to crisis support** when needed

### 2. Social Conversation Assistant (NEW!)
For people who struggle with social cues or conversation anxiety:
- **Analyzes facial expressions** of the person you're talking to
- **Understands emotional context** from their face and words
- **Suggests what to say back** in real-time
- **Provides alternative responses** so you can choose what feels right
- **Explains social cues** to help you understand what they might be feeling

Perfect for people with social anxiety, autism spectrum, or anyone who wants support navigating conversations.

### 3. ARM-Powered Privacy & Speed (NEW!)
EmpathLens now includes **ARM edge processing** for privacy-preserving, ultra-low latency AI:
- **Local facial emotion detection** on ARM device (TensorFlow Lite + ARM NN: **4-6x faster**)
- **Local audio distress detection** using ARM NEON SIMD (**4-5x faster**)
- **Privacy modes**: Keep sensitive data local or send to cloud selectively
- **<100ms total latency** for distress detection (vs 400-600ms cloud-only)
- **Offline capability**: Works even without internet connection
- **60-80% cost reduction** by preprocessing on ARM edge

Supports Raspberry Pi 4/5, NVIDIA Jetson, and ARM64 devices. See `docs/ARM_ARCHITECTURE.md` for details.

## Core Features

### Distress Management States

| State | Intervention | Duration | Example |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| **RISING** | Paced breathing (4-4) | ~30s | "Breathe in for four, out for four." |
| **PANIC** | 4-7-8 breathing | ~60s | "In for four, hold seven, out for eight." |
| **OVERWHELMED** | 5-4-3-2-1 grounding | ~75s | "Name five things you can see." |
| **RECOVERY** | Reinforcement | — | "Your body is settling. Two slow breaths." |
| **CRISIS_RISK** | Escalation offer | — | "Can I contact your support person?" |

### Conversation Assistant Features

- **Facial emotion detection**: Analyzes happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, confusion, interest, etc.
- **Context-aware suggestions**: Considers what they said AND their facial expression
- **Multiple response options**: Get 2-3 alternatives to choose from
- **Tone guidance**: Tells you the recommended tone (friendly, empathetic, casual, etc.)
- **Social cue interpretation**: Explains what they might be feeling or wanting
- **Voice playback**: Hear the suggested response via ElevenLabs TTS

### Safety Guardrails

- ✅ Crisis keyword detection (self-harm, suicide ideation) triggers immediate escalation
- ✅ Post-AI filtering: concise responses, no medical claims
- ✅ "Stop" command immediately ends intervention
- ✅ Escalation after 2 minutes of persistent distress
- ✅ No raw audio/video storage
- ✅ Runs locally with Gemini API

### Using with Meta Glasses

#### Distress Management Mode
1. **Join a Messenger call** or send a message
2. **Say**: "I'm having a panic attack"
3. **Listen** to the breathing guidance (arrives in ~2 seconds)
4. **Follow the breathing cue** for ~45-60 seconds
5. **Respond** with "better", "same", or "worse" when prompted
6. **System adapts** based on your response

#### Conversation Assistant Mode
1. **Join a Messenger call** with someone
2. The glasses capture the other person's face and what they say
3. **You receive** real-time suggestions on what to say back
4. **Choose** from the suggested responses or alternatives
5. **Speak naturally** using the guidance

### Stop Command

Say or type **"stop"** at any time to end any intervention immediately.

- **Intervention cooldown**: 30 seconds between interventions
- **Escalation timeout**: 120 seconds of persistent distress
- **Max response words**: 18 words per response (distress mode)

## Troubleshooting

### "Gemini API key not set"
- Ensure you've added your API key to `.env`
- Get a free key at [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

### No voice output
- Check ElevenLabs API key is set correctly
- Verify API key is valid: [elevenlabs.io/app](https://elevenlabs.io/app)
- Service falls back to text-only if TTS unavailable

### Facial analysis not working
- Ensure image is provided as `frame_url` or `frame_base64`
- Check that Gemini API key has vision API access
- Verify image format is supported (JPEG, PNG)

### Glasses not responding
- Verify Messenger extension is monitoring the correct chat
- Check provider URLs in extension settings
- Test API directly with curl first

### State machine too sensitive
- Increase `TEXT_WEIGHT` in `.env` (e.g., `0.8`)
- Adjust thresholds in `state_machine.py`

## Privacy & Security

### What's Stored
- ✅ Ephemeral session state (current distress level, intervention history)
- ✅ No raw audio or video
- ✅ No message history (processed then discarded)
- ✅ Temporary audio files (auto-cleaned after 1 hour)
- ✅ No facial images stored (analyzed then deleted)

### What's Shared
- ❌ Text and images sent to Google Gemini API for processing
- ❌ Generated responses sent to ElevenLabs for TTS (optional)
- ❌ No analytics, telemetry, or third-party tracking
- ❌ All processing happens via API calls, no local data retention

### Consent
- User must explicitly enable the extension and join monitored chats
- "Stop" command immediately ends all processing
- Sessions expire after 30 minutes of inactivity

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
python tests/test_service.py

# Run simple test
python tests/simple_test.py

# Test with increased logging
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Extending the System

#### Add a new intervention:
1. Update `app/models.py`: Add `InterventionType`
2. Update `app/core/interventions.py`: Map state → intervention
3. Update `app/services/gemini_client.py`: Add prompt guidance

#### Add new crisis keywords:
1. Edit `app/core/detector.py`: Add patterns to `CRISIS_KEYWORDS`

#### Change detection thresholds:
1. Edit `app/core/state_machine.py`: Adjust `THRESHOLDS` dict

#### Customize conversation suggestions:
1. Edit `app/services/conversation_assistant.py`: Modify prompts in `ConversationCoach`

## Use Cases

### 1. Panic Attack Support
**Scenario**: You're in public and feel a panic attack coming
- Discreetly activate through your glasses
- Get immediate breathing guidance
- Follow along privately without drawing attention

### 2. Social Anxiety at Events
**Scenario**: You're at a networking event and someone approaches you
- Glasses capture their face and what they say
- Get real-time suggestions on how to respond
- Choose responses that match your style

### 3. Autism Spectrum Support
**Scenario**: You struggle to read facial expressions
- System analyzes their emotions for you
- Explains what their facial cues mean
- Suggests appropriate responses based on context

### 4. Interview Preparation
**Scenario**: You're nervous about conversations in interviews
- Practice with the system analyzing interactions
- Learn appropriate responses to questions
- Build confidence in social situations

## Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations
- Requires internet for Gemini API
- English language only
- No persistent user profiles or learning
- Single-user sessions (no group support)
- Facial analysis requires clear face images

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Audio prosody analysis (pitch, pace, tremor)
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Adaptive learning from user preferences
- [ ] Integration with wearables (heart rate, HRV)
- [ ] Offline mode with local models
- [ ] Group conversation support
- [ ] Real-time conversation tracking
- [ ] Personalized response style learning
